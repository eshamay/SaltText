Dear Prof. John Fourkas and reviewers,

	 Thank you for considering our manuscript submission and the review process. We are submitting the manuscript with modifications made to reflect the reviewer's comments. We have kept the manuscript as it was but have compiled supporting information that we feel does not belong in the main body of the paper, but will be of interest to our audience as noted by the reviewer.
	 Regarding the chi(2) spectra, we have supplied the corresponding plots of the real and imaginary spectral components. We believe that the information the reviewer suggested is contained in these plots. Unlike the air-water work that we have reported previously, in our group's experimental work on the liquid-liquid systems over the years we found the non-resonant background to be negligible. Thus, our experimental works have not reported the non-resonant backgrounds, and our calculations correspond with those results. Thus we have not included any plots regarding the non-resonant background of our systems.
	 We have included in the supporting information a section on the electric field through the interfacial region. The electric field was calculated as a function of position within the interface to show the effect of the various salt ions. We thus clarify our statement regarding "field-screening" effects by the nitrate and sulfate ions and provide more quantitative information regarding the phenomena. We have also drawn a connection between the electric-field enhancements and the SFG spectra based on the position of the field disturbances and the known positions of waters contributing to the different spectral regions.
	 Thank you for your consideration. We believe that the comments and modifications help to strengthen the manuscript and provide further information of interest to our audience.
