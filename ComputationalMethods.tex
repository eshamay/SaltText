\section{Computational Methods}

The molecular dynamics methods used in this work reproduce those from our previous computational efforts with some modifications described below.\cite{Hore2008,Walker2006b,Hore2007} All molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the Amber 9 software package. The polarizable molecular model parameters are taken from previous works on similar systems.\cite{Chang1997a,Dang1999,Thomas2007,Hrobarik2006,Chang1995} The polarizable POL3 model was used for water molecules.\cite{Caldwell1995} Fully polarizable models have been used in previous interface simulation studies because they are known to more accurately reproduce interfacial structure and free energy profiles.\cite{Rivera2006,Wick2007,Petersen2005b,Dang1998}

A total of 4 systems were simulated consisting of aqueous salt and CCl$_4$ phases. A slab geometry was used to produce two interface regions, the analyses of which were averaged.\cite{Hore2007} The organic region was formed in a box 30-\ang\ on a side with 169 CCl$_4$ molecules to reproduce standard temperature density of 1.59-$\frac{g}{mL}$. The aqueous region was formed in a box 30x30x60-\ang, with the long axis labeled the $z$-axis. The number of water molecules and ions varied for each system in order to reproduce a density of 1.2-M. The specific populations of each molecule are listed in table \ref{densities}. The organic and aqueous boxes were then joined to form a system 90-\ang\ long with interface areas of 30x30-\ang.

The water, salts, and CCl$_4$ were each randomly packed into their respective boxes with a minimum packing distance of 2.4-\ang. After joining the aqueous and organic phases and forming the two interfaces, the total system was energy minimized using a conjugate gradient method. Following minimization, the system was equilibrated at a constant temperature of 298-K with weak coupling to a heat bath for a period of 10-ns, using a simulation timestep of 1.0-fs. A non-bonded potential cutoff of 9.0-\ang\ was used. Following equilibration the system was simulated with the same parameters for a further 10-ns with atomic position data recorded every 50-fs. This resulted in a total of 200,000 snapshots which were used in the data analysis.
