	simulations of strong 1:1 electrolytes. These errors arise from an
	ad hoc adaptation of Aqvist's cation parameters. The result is the
	rapid formation of large, unphysical clusters at concentrations that
	are well below solubility limits. The observed unphysical behavior
	poses a serious challenge for simulating ions around highly charged
	polymers such as nucleic acids. In this communication, we explain
	the source of this unphysical behavior. To facilitate the continued
	use of the popular AMBER parameters, we prescribe a simple fix whereby
	Aqvist's cations and anions are used in conjunction with the AMBER
	forcefield for nucleic acids. A preliminary test of this strategy
	suggests that the proposed fix is reasonable and is likely to be
	generalizable for simulating diffuse and specific ion binding to

  abstract = {Aqueous solutions of 1:1 strong electrolytes are considered to be
	the prototype for complete ionic dissociation. Nonetheless, clustering
	of strong 1:1 electrolytes has been widely reported in all atom molecular
	dynamics simulations, and their presence is indirectly implicated
	in a diverse range of experimental results. Is there a physical basis
	for nonidealities such as ion pairing and cluster formation in aqueous
	solutions of strong 1:1 electrolytes? We attempt to answer this question
	by direct comparison of results from detailed molecular dynamics
	simulations to experimentally observed properties of 1:1 electrolytes.
	We report the analysis of a series of lengthy molecular dynamics
	simulations of alkali-halide solutions carried out over a wide range
	of physiologically relevant concentrations using explicit representations
	of water molecules. We find evidence for pronounced nonideal behavior
	of ions at all concentrations in the form of ion pairs and clusters
	which are in rapid equilibrium with dissociated ions. The phenomenology
	for ion pairing seen in these simulations is congruent with the multistep
	scheme proposed by Eigen and Tamm based on data from ultrasonic absorption
	experiments. For a given electrolyte, we show that the dependence
	of cluster populations on concentration can be described through
	a single set of equilibrium constants. We assess the accuracy of
	calculated ion pairing constants by favorable comparison to estimates
	obtained by Fuoss and co-workers and based on conductometric experiments.
	Ion pairs and clusters form on length scales where the size of individual
	water molecules is as important as the hard core radius of ions.
	Ion pairing results as a balance between the favorable Coulomb interactions
	and the unfavorable partial desolvation of ions needed to form a
	pair.},

	about the carbonyl C-N bond in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) have been
	examined through a combination of gas-phase ab initio calculations
	and solution-phase statistical mechanics simulations. The geometries
	of the planar ground state and the transition states with the nitrogen
	lone-pair anti and syn to the oxygen were optimized with the 6-31G(d)
	basis set. Subsequent calculations of the vibrational frequencies
	and correlation energies (MP4(fc)SDTQ/6-31G(d)//6-31G(d)) predict
	DELTA-G double dagger,s of 14.6 and 18.7 kcal/mol for the anti and
	syn transition states at 298 K. NMR measurements have yielded a gas-phase
	DELTA-G double dagger of 15-16 kcal/mol. Solute-solvent potential
	functions were refined by fitting to results of 6-31G(d) calculations
	for the ground and transition states interacting with a water molecule
	in 17 low-energy orientations. These potentials were used in Monte
	Carlo simulations that yielded the changes in free energies in solvation
	in TIP4P water and the OPLS model of carbon tetrachloride. The observed
	ca. 2-kcal/mol increase in DELTA-G double dagger for water versus
	the aprotic solvent was reproduced; however, only a 0.4-kcal/mol
	barrier increase was computed for CCl4 relative to the gas phase,
	while the experimental shift is 1-2 kcal/mol. The discrepancy may
	come from amide aggregation and variations in the transmission coefficient,
	whereas an explanation involving activation volumes is rejected.
	It is also predicted that the syn transition state becomes competitive
	with the anti in water, and hydrogen bonding analyses clarify the
	origin of the differential hydration.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate
	the behavior of aqueous sodium nitrate in interfacial environments.
	Polarizable potentials for the water molecules and the nitrate ion
	in solution were employed. Calculated surface tension data at several
	concentrations are in good agreement with measured surface tension
	data. The surface potential of NaNO3 solutions at two concentrations
	also compare favorably with experimental measurements. Density profiles
	suggest that NO3- resides primarily below the surface of the solutions
	over a wide range of concentrations. When the nitrate anions approach
	the surface of the solution, they are significantly undercoordinated
	compared to in the bulk, and this may be important for reactions
	where solvent cage effects play a role such as photochemical processes.
	Surface water orientation is perturbed by the presence of nitrate
	ions, and this has implications for experimental studies that probe
	interfacial water orientation. Nitrate ions near the surface also
	have a preferred orientation that places the oxygen atoms in the
	plane of the interface.},

  review = {A study of nitrate ions at the solution-air interface. A molecular
	dynamics simulation with sodium nitrate.
	
	
	simulation setup: POL3 water with polarizability on both the water
	and the ions. Two sets of polarizability data were used for the nitrate,
	but primary reference was made to the force field data established
	by Salvador (ref 38 - Phys Chem Chem Phys 2003, 5, 3752). Polarizability
	of 1.49 Ang^3 was put on each of the three nitrate oxygens
	
	
	Results: 
	
	- surface tension data
	
	- NO3 anions found below the surface at a wide range of concentrations
	
	- Surface no3 are undercoordinated compared to the subsurface ones
	
	- presence of no3 changes surface water orientation
	
	- Oxygen plane of surface nitrates is parallel to the interface plane
	
	
	Study of a single no3 anion in an infinite slab:
	
	- shows different coordination than the bulk species
	
	- with polarizability on, the nitrate stays on the surface
	
	- with no polarizability it sinks into the bulk
	
	- RDF analysis was performed of no3-h2o
	
	
	Water structure at the interface:
	
	- The interface is deeper (structured further in) at higher concentrations
	- the orientation parameter (cos(theta)) is larger for deeper},
