\section{Calculated Sum-Frequency Spectra}

The computed SFG spectra for each system are presented in figure \ref{fig:sfg-spectra} along with the experimental spectra from our previous work with these same salt solutions.\cite{McFearin2009}

The water/CCl$_4$ interface spectrum (black-dashed line) is provided on the plot for each of the simulated systems for reference. The bottom-right figure is a reproduction of the experimental spectra from McFearin et al to show the intensity and lineshape trends found previously for these systems.\cite{McFearin2009}}
