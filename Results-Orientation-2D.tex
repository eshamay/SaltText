\section{Water Orientation}
The orientation of water within the aqueous/organic interface of the system was defined using the angles formed by molecular axes and the fixed reference axis of the system (perpendicular to the interfacial plane). The two molecular axes used are the water bisector, pointing from the hydrogen side to the oxygen, and the vector normal to the plane formed by the three atoms of the water molecule, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:water-angles}. Figure \ref{fig:2dhisto} shows the angle profiles of both the molecular bisector and the molecular plane normal of water molecules relative to the system reference axis at various depths into the aqueous phase. Darker red regions of the plots indicate higher orientational populations, while homogeneous coloring across the angle range indicates orientational isotropy.

Two profiles were developed for characterizing interfacial water orientation based on the bisector and molecular normal vector angles formed with the system references axis (see Figure \ref{fig:water-angles}). Each profile shows the water population for each cosine of the respective angle as a function of distance to the Gibbs dividing surface (located at 0.0). The profiles in the left column are of the bisector vector, and those on the right are of the molecular normal vector.

Previous studies have provided a detailed overview of water orientation at the interface with both air and organic phases.\cite{McFearin2009,Hore2008,Fan2009,Wick2006c,Wick2008a} The topmost water layers are highly ordered because of their contact with the organic phase, and it has been suggested that ordering of both the organic and water molecules would lead to a field across the boundary of the interface.\cite{McFearin2009,Hore2008} This can influence charged species, and the ordering and orientation of the H-bond network. Our recent experimental SFG results suggest that the accumulation of charged ions leads to a field-screening that affects the orientation of waters in the topmost layers. This is complemented by the results of the current study.

A range of 0\costhetarange1 ($0\degree<\theta<90\degree$ - left figure) suggests that one of the OH-bonds will always point into the aqueous phase, and the other will straddle the plane of the interface. In the range -0.5\costhetarange0.5 ($60\degree<\theta<120\degree$ - center figure) one OH-bond will always point out of the aqueous phase, and the other will always remain pointing in towards the water bulk. The molecular normal angle, $\phi$, has a narrow range for interfacial waters in all of the systems spanning approx. 0.7\costhetarange1.0 (right). The range of $\phi$ keeps the topmost waters lying mostly flat on the interface, but with a narrow range of twist with OH-bonds pointing both into, and out of the interface.}

% Neat-h2o bisector
In the left column of figure \ref{fig:2dhisto} are the bisector orientation profiles for each of the systems. The far-left dark-blue regions of the plots show the \ctc bulk near to the interface where few or no waters are found. The GDS is located at a depth of 0.0\angs. To the far right in the water bulk, the flat, uniformly-colored profile represents the expected isotropic orientation of the waters. The regions of interest lie around the GDS within the interface. The top bisector profile is that of the neat-\wat system, and it shows a transition in the profile beginning just above the GDS and extending up to 5\angs into the aqueous side, at which point the profile becomes orientationally isotropic. At the GDS most of the waters are oriented between 0.0\costhetarange1.0, indicating a range of orientation as depicted in figure \ref{fig:angle-ranges}a. In this range one of the OH-bonds points into the aqueous side, and the other straddles the interfacial plane with a slight affinity towards the organic \ctc phase. Just under the surface, between 2-4\angs into the neat-\wat phase, a dark-red region spanning approx. 0.7\costhetarange1.0 appears. This narrow orientational range is depicted in figure \ref{fig:angle-ranges}b, and is similar to the waters in the topmost aqueous layer nearer to the GDS, but limited such that both OH bonds point into the \wat side, with one of them only straddling the interfacial plane with a tendancy to point into the \wat phase.

The neat-\wat bisector orientational profile is comparable to previous simulations of the same neat-\wat reference system. Using different simulation parameters for the same neat-\wat/\ctc system, Wick and Dang found the free-OH to point slightly into the \ctc phase at the GDS with an angle of \costheta$_{free-OH}\approx 0.4$. This corresponds to \costheta$_{bisector} \approx 0.5$ in the this work's angle definition. Similarly, deeper into the surface the angle profile dimishes such that $\cos(\theta_{free-OH})\approx 0.0$ within 5\angs of the GDS, corresponding to $\cos(\theta_{bisector})\approx 0.8$ in the current scheme. Those results agree with this work's neat-\wat profile, further complementing the experimental SFG conclusions performed on the same systems.\cite{McFearin2009,Scatena2001}

%The bisector exhibits an affinity to point such that 0\costhetarange1. The orientation of the OH-bonds for such an angle range is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:angle-ranges}. In the case of the neat-water reference system, the ``free-OH'' bond is generally pointing out of the aqueous phase, but often points within the plane of the interface. At 3\angs into the neat-water surface, there appears a peak spanning approx. 0.7\costhetarange0.9 that stretches out to just past 5\angs, at which point the profile becomes flat across the values of $\theta$.

% Salt bisectors
Bisector angle profiles for the salt systems show different behavior than that of the reference neat-\wat system. The profiles of the salt systems at the GDS all center about the \costheta$=0$ region, with a range of approx. -0.5\costhetarange0.5. This indicates a straddling water molecule with the orientational range depicted in figure \ref{fig:angle-ranges}c. The water in that range is clearly oriented such that one OH-bond always points out of the aqueous phase into the \ctc, and the other always points in to the water bulk. The OH-bond that would straddle the interface in the neat-water system points out of the interface with a greater angle. This orientation, centered about \costheta$\approx 0$, extends into the water phase up to 3\angs, at which point the profile shifts to the darker region near -1.0\costhetarange0.7. The sub-surface region of the profile between 4-7\angs in each system corresponds to a flip of the water orientation, as referred to in a recent SFG study as a ``flip-flop'' model where water orients to counteract the field of charged species at interfaces.\cite{Nihonyanagi2009} The cation density enhancement in each salt system is within the region of 5-7\angs below the GDS. The waters may be orienting with the negatively charged oxygen end towards those cations, and with the field established by the ion double-layer within the interface. In each of the salt bisector profiles there is a clear depletion of waters oriented towards \costheta$=1$ suggesting that alignment of the bisector with the reference axis is not prefered. The effect is most pronounced in the \sodsul system where the distance between counterion density enhancements is smallest, and the transition in the bisector profile is the most abrupt, changing from a profile mostly in the range of -1.0\costhetarange0.5 to isotropic orientation quickly near 8\angs into the aqueous phase. The \sodnit system bisector profile shows the effect furthest into the water bulk, extending almost to 13\angs. Counterion density enhancement is most separated in \sodnit, however, and most of the orientational affinity for -1.0\costhetarange0.5 occurs within the first 10\angs of the surface. The bisector profile of the \nacl system is broadest with -1.0\costhetarange0.7 starting near the GDS. Also, orientational isotropy is shallowest in the \nacl system starting near 7\angs into the surface.

It appears that the field established by the anion-cation pairing within the interface affects the depth to which waters are oriented before the bulk isotropic profile begins. Also, the range of orientations beneath the surface is dependent on the properties of the anion. The weakly polarizable \cl anion does not restrict the orientational range as much as the more polarizable \nit and \sul. Anions also appear to control the depth to which the water orientation is felt, with the most surface-active \nit anion causing the deepest effect. \sul anion shows the strongest restriction on the range of bisector angles, and the sharpest orientational transition to the bulk, which may be attributed to the higher charge of the anion, and thus the stronger field established between the counterions in the system.

%The sharpest transition in the bisector profiles is that of the Na$_2$SO$_4$ system. This can be attributed to the proximity of the anion and cation density peaks in the water bulk, which is shortest in the system. Following the trend is the broadest bisector profile of NaNO$_3$ that extends past 10\angs past the interface, and corresponds to the greatest anion-cation density peak distance. NaCl follows the trend as the bisector orientation profile extends to the same depth as the Na$_2$SO$_4$ system, but the transition to the isotropic region is not nearly as sharp, as the electric double-layer set up by the anion and cation densities is not as strong. This is both because of the proximity of the ions, but also because of the higher charge of the divalent SO$_4^{2-}$ anion compared to the monovalent Cl$^-$. The field created by the anion-cation pairing within the interface affects both the depth to which waters are oriented, and also the width of the transition to isotropic orientation.

% Water normal
%The molecular plane normal in the right column of figure \ref{fig:2dhisto} is centered about the flatter orientations with 0.7\costhetarange1.0. This profile suggests that the water lies flat on the interface with a twist of up to 45\degree.  Molecular normal orientation profiles are very similar across the systems investigated, with each profile showing an affinity for the flat orientation starting just before the GDS, and extending as deep as 7\angs in the water and \nacl systems, and between 3-4\angs in the \sodnit and \sodsul polyatomic salt systems.

\newcommand{\phiprof}{$\phi$-profile}

Orientational profiles for the molecular plane normal of the water molecules (\phiprof s) are found in the right-column of figure \ref{fig:2dhisto}. The range of a \phiprof is limited to 0.0\cosphirange1.0 because of the inherent symmetry of the plane of the water molecule. More similarity is shared between the \phiprof s than for the bisector profiles. The neat-\wat profile is typical of the four profiles in appearance with a large clustering of water population in the range of 0.7\cosphirange1.0 between the GDS and up to 7 \angs into the aqueous phase. This particular $\phi$ range is depicted in figure \ref{fig:angle-ranges}d, showing the mostly flat (i.e. parallel to the interface) orientation of the molecular plane. It is noteable that the $\phi$-orientation is affected to the same depth as the first peak (dark-red region) of the bisector profile. However, in the salt systems the second peak near to \costheta$=-1.0$ begin at a depth where the \phiprof has already become isotropic. Thus, in the salt systems, the first water layer (between the GDS and almost 4 \angs into the surface) has a defined $\phi$-orientation that is rather flat on the interfacial plane, but the deeper waters (4-7 \angs into the interface) are isotropic in $\phi$, and oriented with \costheta closer to -1.0 (an orientation with oxygen pointing into the water bulk, and hydrogens more towards the interface).

By virtue of the interdependence of $\theta$ and $\phi$ (the bisector is perpendicular to the molecular plane normal at all times) a value of \cosphi$=1.0$ implies \costheta$=0$, and vice-versa. However, a broad $\theta$-range allows for a full range of $\phi$ values. Although the second peak of the salt-system bisector profiles is concentrated near to \costheta$=-1.0$, the corresponding \phiprof is isotropic. This deeper region (the second water layer) orients with the bisector counteracting the field of the anion-cation double-layer, and the only apparent affinity is that of placing the oxygens closer to the cation density enhancement (and the hydrogens closer to the anion layer), while the \phiprof spans the entire orientational range.
