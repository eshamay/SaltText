\section{Water Orientation}
The orientation of water within the aqueous/organic interface of the system was defined using the angles formed by molecular axes and the fixed long-axis of the system (perpendicular to the interfacial plane). The two molecular axes used are the water bisector, pointing from the hydrogen side to the oxygen, and the vector normal to the plane formed by the three atoms of the water molecule. Figure \ref{fig:water-angles} illustrates the angles of interest relative to the system reference axis (i.e. Z-axis) as the molecule takes on various orientations.
