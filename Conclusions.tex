\section{Conclusions}

The unique environment created by interactions between water and hydrophobic molecules makes ionic adsorption and transport across interfaces possible. Aqueous-hydrophobic surfaces are of prime importance in applications ranging from ion transport, chemical remediation, and catalysis, to chemical synthesis. Complex interfaces between aqueous media and organic phases enhance chemical reactions, and this motivate further research to understand such environments. This study provides an important step in understanding aqueous-organic surfaces by computationally examining simple aqueous salt solutions interfaced with hydrophobic liquid \ctc. Through a combination of simulations and computational analysis, the nature of ionic adsorption and its effect on water hydrogen-bonding, geometry, and orientation at the liquid-liquid boundary is determined.

Analysis of the component density profiles provides a thorough microscopic picture of ionic surface affinity, double-layering, and effect on interfacial size. While the smaller and less polarizable \cl anion behaves at the \ctcwat surface much like at the \airwat one, the larger surface-active anions have altered interactions with water. Density profile analysis shows that the \nit anion exhibits a much greater surface affinity near the organic phase than at an air interface. The orientational analysis of the solutions shows that the salts in each system cause a change to the water orientation at the \ctcwat surface. The orientation profiles show a stratification of water geometries consistent with the emerging picture of a multi-layered surface region with varied geometries and interactions. This reorientation subsequently affects the ionic double-layering and subsurface waters. Such effects are manifested in spectroscopic changes to water's vibrational OH modes. SFG spectra computed in this study build the necessary bridge to our previous SFG work by offering direct comparison of the computational and experimental results. The surface spectroscopic signals are altered relative to the ion-free signal, indicating a change to the water bonding at the interface due to the salts. The divalent \sul anion acts to enhance the surface hydrogen-bonding, while the monovalent ions diminish it. Both the organic phase and the salt anion species in solution act to dramatically alter the geometry and spectroscopy of water's surface. 

We have thus moved toward our goal of further understanding the behavior and impact of ions and a hydrophobic phase on water at liquid-liquid interfaces. The complementing results of both simulation and experiment have strengthened our certainty of some of the underlying surface science of these systems, but challenges still remain. A more complete picture would include knowledge of different cation effects, as well as the changes to the surface by different hydrophobic phases. The ability to analyze these important interfacial environments both theoretically and experimentally now provides us with the tools to better develop our understanding them.

%The \nit density at the interface is enhanced far above the bulk level near an organic phase. 

%Simulations were conducted of the interface between a neat-\wat system, and three aqueous salt systems, and \ctc. By analyzing the density profiles of the water and the various ions in solution we found that both the water and ionic behavior at the liquid-liquid boundary is different than at the air-liquid one. Anions that have been found to be depleted at the air-water interface such as \nit have a strong interfacial affinity at the \ctcwat interface. Similarly, the orientation of water molecules is different at the liquid-liquid interface, and further altered when ions are present in solution. Depending on the ion surface affinity the waters orient to different extents and to different depths, supporting the conclusions of previous simulations and experiment. The field of interface simulation is further exposing the microscopic foundations of the macroscopic experimental results from techniques such as interface-specific spectroscopies. In our work we have connected the simulation results and methods by computing the SFG spectra to further complement previous experimental efforts. Further effort is still needed to provide a fuller understanding of the boundaries of aqueous systems and the effects of salt ions.
