	This book contains a series of reviews/essays on various topics in
	laser spectroscopy.
	
	
	The primary interest was in the piece by Shen (pg 139-165). The theory
	section was very heavy in the math of quantum optics, and it was
	just a topical selection of the derivations. A better reference for
	theory is Shen's larger review.
	
	
	There's mention of a paper by Richmond (Prog. Surf. Sci., 28, 1 (1988))
	
	
	The review goes through multiple applications and systems analyzed
	by SFG
	
	
	One system is the neat liquid water/vapor interface. A synopsis of
	the band assignments is given, but nothing specific beyond the free-OH
	mode. The rest are all grouped as "hydrogen bound water".
	
	
	There's a reference to an earlier MD work done that contradicts the
	SFG results:

	to extract infrared and Raman intensities in addition to the vibrational
	density of states of a molecular system. We applied the method to
	deuterated water D2O using the ab initio MP2 level of electronic
	structure theory. The initial conditions of kinetic and potential
	energies of the trajectories were chosen to be consistent with the
	level nu = 0 of the harmonic normal modes. We obtained the density
	of states and the IR and Raman intensities by means of the Fourier
	transforms of the autocorrelation functions of the velocities, dipole
	moment time-derivatives, and polarizability tensor time-second-derivatives,
	respectively. The calculated spectrum is in excellent quantitative
	agreement with the experimentally observed spectrum. The method holds
	promise to obtain very accurate simulated spectra for small molecules,
	including IR and Raman intensities. Extensions to the characterization
	of vibrational effects on the non-linear optical properties of molecules

	data, the orientational parameter D (D=< cos theta >/< cos(3) theta
	>) value and the relative surface density of the interfacial water
	molecules at these aqueous solution surfaces were determined. From
	these results, we found that addition of each of the six salts caused
	an increase in the thickness of the interfacial water layer at the
	surfaces to a certain extent. Noticeably, both the cations and the
	anions contributed to the changes, and the abilities to increase
	the thickness of the interfacial water layer were in the following
	order: KBr>NaBr>KCl>NaCl similar to NaF>KF. Since these changes cannot
	be factorized into individual anion and cation contributions, there
	are possible ion pairing or association effects, especially for the
	NaF case. We also found that the orientational parameter D values
	of the interfacial water molecules changed to opposite directions
	for the aqueous solutions of the three sodium salts versus the aqueous
	solutions of the three potassium salts. These findings clearly indicated
	unexpected specific Na+ and K+ cation effects at the aqueous solution
	surface. These effects were not anticipated from the recent molecular
	dynamics simulation results, which concluded that the Na+ and K+
	cations can be treated as small nonpolarizable hard ions and they
	are repelled from the aqueous interfaces. These results suggest that

	so the work takes a neat-water interface SFG spectrum and compares
	it to various ion-water SFG spectra. Trends in spectra will give
	the ability to connect ion density profiles to spectra - completely
	empirical.
	
	
	More polarizable species = more likely to be found at the surface.
	Taking out polarizability from simulations recovers the predicted
	results of the theory of electrolyte surfaces. The polarizability
	can be tweaked on molecules/ions to change the effect.
	
	
	This simulation uses the 2002 Morita+Hynes method for surface spectra.
	
	
	A flexible SPC/E like model (this is non-polarizable) by Ferguson
	is used for water, and a polarizable potential is used for the ions.
	This means that water-OH bonds are allowed to vibrate.
	
	Previous studies by the same group have shown that the same results
	can be found with polarizable models only on the ions and not the
	water.
	
	
	Amber 7 is modified to include the cubic terms for OH-stretching (this
	leads to the polarization catastrophe).
	
	
	Correlation functions were evaluated using the Wiener-Kinchin method
	
	
	Questions:
	
	1) How were the system dipole and polarizability computed/evaluated?
	
	
	2) How was amber modified (cubic terms on OH-stretch)?
	
	
	Systems analyzed/constructed:
	
	1) neat water
	
	2) 1.2 M sodium iodide in water with IPOL (polarizable) ions
	
	3) Same as (2) but without IPOL
	
	
	As expected the polarizable ions show enhanced presence at the interface.
	
	
	Calls into question the assignment of the ~3200 and ~3400 bands made
	by Richmond and Raymond. Richmond assignments were made based on
	the insensitivity of the bands to the addition of salts.
	
	
	The new interpretation is made based on computational analysis of
	IR spectrum of ice nanoparticles.
	
	~3200 is assigned (via MD/calcs) to donor-OH stretches
	
	~3400 is assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated water},

	The nitrate and nitrite solutions exhibit similar depth-dependent

  review = {This is a preprint collaboration between Victoria Buch and Geri Richmond
	that unifies the treatment of SFG spectra from the results of MD
	simulations on ice, water, and acid solutions. It introduces a new
	scheme for computing the SFG spectra, and gives a 'collective mode'
	interpretation of them for water stretching below the free-OH peak.
	
	
	Very clean-cut ice is produced and analyzed in the PPP polarization
	- this apparently gives good information that hasn't been closely
	watched before.
	
	
	The low H-bond stretching arises from 'collective motions' of molecules
	in the condensed phase.
	
	
	The computational scheme used is based on the exciton model. The influence
	of H-bonding on stretching modes is calculated as a decreasing function
	w(E), where E is the field parallel to the OH bond at the hydrogen
	atom.
	
	- The field due to fixed charges and induced dipoles
	
	- Dipole and polarizability are summed over all OH contributions
	
	
	About 30% of protonated waters at the surface are zundel-like
	
	
	Collective motions cause the lower frequency stretching intensities,
	and are around because of downward facing OH bonds at the surface.
	
	These bonds point into the bulk rather than out of the bulk
	
	The ones pointing out give higher-frequency intensities.},

	azopolymers, which are known to display a huge birefringence (Deltan
	exceeding -0.45 at 632.8 nm) and a high stability and are attractive
	materials for rewritable recording media and optical memories. First,
	various real-time birefringence experiments are performed using a
	linearly polarized irradiation at 532.0 nm and probing the thin film
	sample at 675.0 nm to confirm the largest An values ever reported
	for such amorphous polymers. Then, polarized transmission measurements
	in the UV-visible and mid-infrared spectral ranges are compared for
	an isotropic and anisotropic sample. They provide strong evidences
	for cooperative orientational effects and for the establishment of
	a biaxial symmetry; the two average orientation factors <F-2,F-0>
	and <F-2,F-2> are thus extracted from infrared data for several vibrational
	modes. The remaining and related fourth rank factors, namely <F-4,F-0>,

	are presented. The interactions between H2O-H2O, H2O-CCl4, and CCl4-CCl4
	are described using the polarizable potential models developed in
	our laboratory. To our knowledge, this work is the first molecular
	dynamics simulations of the liquid-liquid interfacial equilibrium
	properties that explicitly includes nonadditive polarization effects.
	Molecular dynamics results of a 300 ps simulation following an extensive
	equilibration process indicate that the liquid interface is very
	stable, the density profile of H2O is very smooth, while that of
	CCl4 exhibits some oscillations. It is found that locally there is
	a sharp transition from one liquid phase to the other, but the overall
	interface is broadened by thermal fluctuations as indicated by the
	liquid density profiles. Calculated radial distribution functions
	suggest that the local structures of CCl4 and H2O remain unchanged
	from the bulk liquid to the interface. However, the interface does
	induce orientational order of H2O and CCl4 molecules. To study the
	polarization effects on the liquid-liquid interfacial equilibrium
	properties, we have calculated the total and induced dipole moments
	of H2O and CCl4 molecules as a function of the distance normal to
	the interface. The calculated dipole moments of the water molecules
	near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while water
	molecules far from the interface have dipole moments corresponding
	to the bulk values. This behavior can be attributed to the changes
	of the hydrogen bonding patterns and the orientation of water molecules
	near the interface. The induced dipole moments of the CCl4 molecules
	near the interface, on the other hand, are significantly enhanced.
	This is due in part to the strong local field induced by the water
	molecules at the interface. The calculated electric potentials using
	the dipole moment approach help us to analyze the orientations of
	water and CCl4 molecules at the interface. (C) 1996 American Institute

	of the gas phase and solution phase properties of the Br- anion are
	quite similar to that of the Cl- ion. At the interface, however,
	the interactions of the Br- and Cl- anions with the water interface
	appeared to be significantly different. We found that the anions

	the transport mechanism of an I- across the water/dichloromethane

	be unfavorable oil enthalpic grounds. The two-layer interfacial water
	structure model implies that there should be four distinct types
	of OH stretches for this system. Namely, one directs upward and another
	points downward in each layer. Interestingly, VSFS experiments revealed
	the presence of four OH stretch region peaks at 3 117, 3222, 3448,
	and 3696 cm(-1). The phases of the 3 117 and 3696 cm(-1) resonances
	carried a positive sign, which indicates that these features arise
	from OH groups with protons facing upward toward the air. The other
	two resonances emanate from OH groups with protons facing downward
	toward the bulk aqueous solution, On the basis of this, we assign
	the 3117 cm(-1) peak to the OH moiety from a water molecule in the
	second layer, which is hydrogen bonded upward toward the top layer.
	On the other hand, the peak at 3222 cm(-1) should arise from water
	molecules in the top layer with the OH moiety facing downward to
	hydrogen bond to the second layer. The 3448 cm(-1) peak arises from
	hydrogen bonding between water molecules in the second layer and
	the more disordered water molecules of the bulk liquid. Finally,
	the peak at 3696 cm(-1) is assigned to the free OH moiety pointing
	upward in the top layer.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic, dielectric, and dynamic properties of a newly parameterized
	flexible water model are studied using molecular dynamics simulations.
	The potential function developed is based on the popular simple point
	charge (SPC) rigid model with the addition of appropriate harmonic
	and anharmonic energy terms for stretching and bending. Care was
	taken to account for the self-polarization and gas-phase monomer
	energy corrections during the parameterization, which have typically
	been ignored in past studies. The results indicate that an increased
	Lennard-Jones repulsive coefficient and slightly scaled partial charges
	are required when adding flexibility to the rigid model potential
	to reliably reproduce the experimental density, energy, and O...O
	radial distribution function of water at 298 K and 1 atm. Analysis
	of the power spectrum derived from the H-velocity autocorrelation
	function allowed the water potential to be evaluated further and
	refined by adjusting the valence forces to fit the vibrational frequencies
	of the gas and liquid. Once a consistent set of parameters was determined,
	the static dielectric properties of the water model were calculated
	at two temperatures using the reaction field method to treat long-range
	forces and correlations. The dielectric constant of 75 +/- 7 calculated
	at 300 K is in good agreement with the experimental value of 78.5.
	The Kirkwood g factor was also examined for temperature dependence
	and showed the correct increasing behavior with decreasing T. As
	a final check of the water potential, the free energies of solvation
	of a flexible water molecule and neon were predicted using thermodynamic
	perturbation methods. The calculated solvation energies of - 7.0
	+/- 0.8 for water and 2.7 +/- 0.7 for neon are both consistent with
	the experimental values of -6.3 and 2.7 kcal/mol. Comparisons are
	made throughout the study with the results of previous rigid and

	Ferguson takes the previously developed SPC (single-point-charge)
	model and adds harmonic and anharmonic terms for stretching and bending.
	This new SPC/E model allows for OH-bond vibrations. It adds in intra-molecular
	vibrations and flexibility
	
	
	Note: at the time, a long MD simulation was considered to be 0.2 to
	1.0 ns!
	
	
	Bond stretching is simulated with a quadratic and cubic function:
	Kl * Kcub * (L - Lo)^3
	
	- this is why Tobias modified his code to get the cubic/anharmonic
	term
	
	- angle bending is still just a quadratic function
	
	
	The total energy expression just adds in the cubic bond-length term.
	
	
	Parametrization was performed to calibrate the model to experimental
	spectra and static/dynamic properties. This was done on a trail and
	error basis until convergence of the data.
	
	
	First, a set of parameters were taken from the gas phase data - this
	is a reasonable starting guess. Then normal mode analysis tweaked
	those values. The path is
	
	1) reasonable estimates
	
	2) simulations
	
	3) tweaking
	
	
	The power spectrum was calculated from the hydrogen autocorrelation
	function transform. In going from the gas to liquid phase the results
	showed the expected blue shift in the bending intensities, but didn't
	show the expected red shift in stretching.
	
	
	The work shows the IR spectrum with and without the cubic term applied.
	
	
	Also, various static and dynamic properties are compared to previous
	studies and water models to build a pretty good case for using the
	SPC/E (SPC-Extended) model.
	
	
	Makes the SHAKE and RATTLE algorithms obsolete.
	
	
	Other models are either less well calibrated, or are too computationally
	expensive for simulation. This one mixes both accuracy and speed

  abstract = {The heterogeneous reaction of NO2 with water on the surface of laboratory
	systems has been known for decades to generate HONO, a major source
	of OH that drives the formation of ozone and other air pollutants
	in urban areas and possibly in snowpacks. Previous studies have shown
	that the reaction is first order in NO2 and in water vapor, and the
	formation of a complex between NO2 and water at the air water interface
	has been hypothesized as being the key step in the mechanism. We
	report data from long path FTIR studies in borosilicate glass reaction
	chambers of the loss of gaseous NO2 and the formation of the products
	HONO, NO and N2O. Further FTIR studies were carried out to measure
	species generated on the surface during the reaction, including HNO3,
	N2O4 and NO2+. We propose a new reaction mechanism in which we hypothesize
	that the symmetric form of the NO2 dimer, N2O4, is taken up on the
	surface and isomerizes to the asymmetric form, ONONO2. The latter
	autoionizes to NO+NO3-, and it is this intermediate that reacts with
	water to generate HONO and surface-adsorbed HNO3. Nitric oxide is
	then generated by secondary reactions of HONO on the highly acidic
	surface. This new mechanism is discussed in the context of our experimental
	data and those of previous studies, as well as the chemistry of such
	intermediates as NO+ and NO2+ that is known to occur in solution.
	Implications for the formation of HONO both outdoors and indoors
	in real and simulated polluted atmospheres, as well as on airborne
	particles and in snowpacks, are discussed. A key aspect of this chemistry
	is that in the atmospheric boundary layer where human exposure occurs
	and many measurements of HONO and related atmospheric constituents
	such as ozone are made, a major substrate for this heterogeneous
	chemistry is the surface of buildings, roads, soils, vegetation and
	other materials. This area of reactions in thin films on surfaces
	(SURFACE = Surfaces, Urban and Remote: Films As a Chemical Environment)
	has received relatively little attention compared to reactions in
	the gas and liquid phases, but in fact may be quite important in
	the chemistry of the boundary layer in urban areas.},

	oxides to form nitrate salts. The nitrate salt can have quite different
	physicochemical properties than the original aerosol, resulting in
	an aerosol that will markedly differ in its climate impact, heterogeneous
	chemistry, and photoactivity. In this Feature Article, we will review
	some aspects of the importance of aqueous nitrate aerosols as well
	as describe a new multi-analysis aerosol reactor system (MAARS) that
	is used to measure the physicochemical properties of these atmospherically
	relevant aerosols. Here we show measurements of the hygroscopic properties,
	cloud condensation nuclei activity, and FTIR extinction of nitrate
	salt aerosol. In particular, we have measured the hygroscopic growth
	of 100 nm size-selected nitrate particles including NaNO3, Ca(NO3)(2),
	Mg(NO3)(2), and a 1:1 mixture of Ca(NO3)(2) and Mg(NO3)(2) as a function
	of relative humidity (RH) at 298 K. Using Kohler theory, we have
	quantified the water content of these particles with increasing RH.
	FTIR extinction measurements of the full size distribution of each
	of the nitrate aerosols are analyzed to yield information about the
	local solvation environment of the nitrate ions and the long-wavelength
	light scattering of the particles at different RH. Furthermore, we
	have measured and compared the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity
	of CaCO3, a large component of mineral dust aerosol, and Ca(NO3)(2),
	a product of atmospherically aged CaCO3 through reaction with nitrogen
	oxides, at supersaturations from 0.1% to 0.9%. These quantitative
	physicochemical data are needed if we are to better understand the
	chemistry as well as the climate effects of atmospheric aerosols
	as they are entrained, transported, reacted, and aged in the atmosphere.

	which makes one end of the ions strongly hydrophobic while the other

	The effect is more pronounced for the hydroxide than for the hydronium.
	Our results are consistent with several experimental observations

	like to form a hydrogen-bonding network at an interface with the

	are diluted in a nonpolar liquid, the hydrogen-bonding network is
	disrupted and the alcohol can now adsorb individually at the interface.

	at the air-water interface (K-p > 1, e.g., K-p,K-SCN- = 1.6). Most
	anions that favor processes that remove protein surface from water
	(e.g., F-), and hence are excluded from protein surface, are also
	excluded from the air-water interface (K-p,K-F- = 0.5). The guanidinium
	cation, a strong protein denaturant and therefore accumulated at
	the protein surface exposed in unfolding, is somewhat excluded from
	the air-water surface (K-p,K-GuH+ = 0.7), but is much less excluded
	than alkali metal cations (e.g., K-p,K-Na+ = 0, K-p,K-K+ = 0.1).

  abstract = {An improved time correlation function (TCF) description of sum frequency
	generation (SFG) spectroscopy was developed and applied to theoretically
	describing the spectroscopy of the ambient water/vapor interface.
	A more general TCF expression than was published previously is presented-it
	is valid over the entire vibrational spectrum for both the real and
	imaginary parts of the signal. Computationally, earlier time correlation
	function approaches were limited to short correlation times that
	made signal processing challenging. Here, this limitation is overcome,
	and well-averaged spectra are presented for the three independent
	polarization conditions that are possible for electronically nonresonant
	SFG. The theoretical spectra compare quite favorably in shape and
	relative magnitude to extant experimental results in the O-H stretching
	region of water for all polarization geometries. The methodological
	improvements also allow the calculation of intermolecular SFG spectra.
	While the intermolecular spectrum of bulk water shows relatively
	little structure, the interfacial spectra (for polarizations that
	are sensitive to dipole derivatives normal to the interface-SSP and
	PPP) show a well-defined intermolecular mode at 875 cm(-1) that is
	comparable in intensity to the rest of the intermolecular structure,
	and has an intensity that is approximately one-sixth of the magnitude
	of the intense free O-H stretching peak. Using instantaneous normal
	mode methods, the resonance is shown to be due to a wagging mode
	localized on a single water molecule, almost parallel to the interface,
	with two hydrogens displaced normal to the interface, and the oxygen
	anchored in the interface. We have also uncovered the origin of another
	intermolecular mode at 95 cm(-1) for the SSP and PPP spectra, and
	at 220 cm(-1) for the SPS spectra. These resonances are due to hindered
	translations perpendicular to the interface for the SSP and PPP spectra,
	and translations parallel to the interface for the SPS spectra. Further,
	by examining the real and imaginary parts of the SFG signal, several
	resonances are shown to be due to a single spectroscopic species
	while the "donor" O-H region is shown to consist of three distinct
	species-consistent with an earlier experimental analysis. (c) 2005

	Two structural modifications of the SAM are studied in an effort
	to shed light on the difference in their resistance to adsorb proteins.
	One modification (hereafter h-SAM), which is stable on the Au substrate,
	is characterized by a helical conformation of the OEG tails and a
	lower areal density. The other, higher density modification (hereafter
	t-SAM), which is experimentally observed on the Ag substrate, has
	their OEG tails in the all-trans conformation. Simulations show that
	water molecules can penetrate into the near surface region of the
	h-SAM in appreciable amounts to bring about substantial conformational
	disordering of the SAM, in agreement with recent sum frequency generation
	experiments. About 75% of the topmost oxygen atoms and even 2% of
	the next to the topmost oxygen atoms of the OEG tails prove to be
	involved in hydrogen bonds with water molecules. By contrast, the
	t-SAM is much more resistant to the penetration of water molecules.
	On interaction with water, it retains a good conformational order
	and shows a noticeably lower surface density of hydrogen bonds with
	water molecules. Both the h- and t-SAM surfaces produce water density
	oscillations that extend at least 3 to 4 molecular diameters into
	the water bulk. The density oscillations are less pronounced near
	the h-SAM, whose surface is ill-defined because of the conformational
	disordering of the OEG tails. The effect of the SAM on the structural
	characteristics of water is short range and practically vanishes
	at separations larger than 1 to 2 molecular diameters away from the

	known to be important, there are currently only a few techniques
	available for studying the nature of surface-adsorbed species as
	well as their chemistry and photochemistry under atmospheric conditions
	of 1 atm pressure and in the presence of water vapor. We report here
	a new laboratory approach using a combination of long path Fourier
	transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) and attenuated total reflectance
	(ATR) FTIR that allows the simultaneous observation and measurement
	of gases and surface species. Theory is used to identify the surface-adsorbed
	intermediates and products, and to estimate their relative concentrations.
	At intermediate relative humidities typical of the tropospheric boundary
	layer, the nitric acid formed during NO2 heterogeneous hydrolysis
	is shown to exist both as nitrate ions from the dissociation of nitric
	acid formed on the surface and as molecular nitric acid. In both
	cases, the ions and HNO3 are complexed to water molecules. Upon pumping,
	water is selectively removed, shifting the NO3-HNO3(H2O)(y) equilibria
	toward more dehydrated forms of HNO3 and ultimately to nitric acid
	dimers. Irradiation of the nitric acid-water film using 300-400 nm
	radiation generates gaseous NO, while irradiation at 254 nm generates
	both NO and HONO, resulting in conversion of surface-adsorbed nitrogen
	oxides into photochemically active NOx. These studies suggest that
	the assumption that deposition or formation of nitric acid provides
	a permanent removal mechanism from the atmosphere may not be correct.
	Furthermore, a potential role of surface-adsorbed nitric acid and
	other species formed during the heterogeneous hydrolysis of NO2 in
	the oxidation of organics on surfaces, and in the generation of gas-phase

  abstract = {A new and direct approach to verify surface heterogeneity as the microscopic

	spectroscopy (SFG) was used to selectively probe the molecules at
	the interface of an alkyl-side-chain polymer [poly(vinyl n-octadecyl
	carbamate-co-vinyl acetate)] with water. The spectra indicate that
	in contact with water, the polymer surface is heterogeneous (having
	areas of differing surface energies). This evidence of surface heterogeneity
	supports the hysteresis observed in the advancing and receding contact
	angles of the polymer surface with water. The same measurements made
	for the chemically and structurally similar surface of an octadecyltrichlorosilane

	of alkyl side chains at the interface was observed, which closely
	follows the melting of crystalline side chains in the bulk. This
	transition explains the increased wettability of the polymer, by
	water, when the temperature is raised above the bulk melting temperature.
	Furthermore, the irreversibility of this ODT suggests that the disordered

  abstract = {Surface tension, gamma, strongly affects interfacial properties in
	fluids. The degree to which polarizability affects gamma in water
	is thus far not well established. To address this situation, we carry
	out molecular dynamics simulations to study the interfacial forces
	acting on a slab of liquid water surrounded by vacuum using the Gaussian
	charge polarizable (GCP) model at 298.15 K. The GCP model incorporates
	both a fixed dipole due to Gaussian distributed charges and a polarizable
	dipole. We find a well-defined bulklike region forms with a width
	of approximate to 31 A. The average density of the bulklike region
	agrees with the experimental value of 0.997 g/cm(3). However, we
	find that the orientation of the molecules in the bulklike region
	is strongly influenced by the interfaces, even at a distance five
	molecular diameters from the interface. Specifically, the orientations
	of both the permanent and induced dipoles show a preferred orientation
	parallel to the interface. Near the interface, the preferred orientation
	of the dipoles becomes more pronounced and the average magnitude
	of the induced dipoles decreases monotonically. To quantify the degree
	to which molecular orientation affects gamma, we calculate the contributions
	to gamma from permanent dipolar interactions, induced dipolar interactions,
	and dispersion forces. We find that the induced dipole interactions
	and the permanent dipole interactions, as well as the cross interactions,
	have positive contributions to gamma, and therefore contribute stability
	to the interface. The repulsive core interactions result in a negative
	contribution to gamma, which nearly cancels the positive contributions
	from the dipoles. The large negative core contributions to gamma
	are the result of small oxygen-oxygen separation between molecules.
	These small separations occur due to the strong attractions between
	hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The final predicted value for gamma (68.65
	mN/m) shows a deviation of approximate to 4\% of the experimental
	value of 71.972 mN/m. The inclusion of polarization is critical for
	this model to produce an accurate value. (c) 2006 American Institute

	1) get the atomic tensor by applying an external electric-field and
	analyze the change in the dipole
	
	2) molecular polarizability is the sum of the alpha tensors for the
	atoms
	
	
	Polarizability of ionic species is reduced in aqueous solvation -
	due to the shrinking electronic density cloud
	
	
	The ions show a clear preference for the surface (interfacial over
	bulk solvation)
	
	
	Method:
	
	- Ab initio calculations performed on gaussian 98 using MP2 and B2LYP
	
	- ab initio MD (using CPMD) of a cluster of 10 water molecules and
	a nitrate
	
	- AIM carried out on PROAIM program
	
	
	- Classical MD performed on AMBER 5 using SPC/POL waters, with SHAKE.
	
	- L-J parameters taken from ref. 35
	
	- qN = +0.95e, qO = -0.65e
	
	alpha = 1.3 A^3
	
	N-O bond length = 1.269 A
	
	cutoff for long-range = 12A with particle mesh ewald (PME)
	
	0.4 ns @ 1 fs timesteps
	
	
	Ref. 37 - the first solvation shell is formed by 3 waters (a planar
	solvation shell). The waters were replaced with point charges for
	a simpler and more efficient method for calculating the solute polarizability.
	
	
	The value of 1.49 A^3 for alpha is 1/3 of the C3-symmetric cluster
	NO3-*(3H2O) cluster alpha. Alpha for nitrogen was neglected (=0)
	
	
	Cluster behavior:
	
	- the distance of the anion to the center of mass of a 9*H2O cluster
	shows a preference of NO3- to the surface of the cluster
	
	- The ion goes through a rapid ejection from the center
	
	- The plane of the ion is normal to the surface of the cluster (preferred
	orientation)
	
	- Justification for the orientation is the in-plane component of alpha
	is dominant
	
	- NO3- in a cluster is expected to have a dipole of ~1.5D
	
	- Water near the ion = ~2.9D dipole, on the surface = ~2.0D
	
	- For the classical MD, the alpha was reduced to 1.3 A^3 to avoid
	the polarization catastrophe.},

	is therefore important to understand the interaction of water with

	We report here studies at 22 degreesC to characterize the interaction
	of water with such materials as a function of relative humidity from
	0 - 100%. The surfaces studied include borosilicate glass, both untreated
	and after cleaning by three different methods (water, hydrogen peroxide

	monolayer of n-octyltrichlorosilane (C8 SAM) on glass, halocarbon
	wax coatings prepared by two different methods, and several different
	types of Teflon coatings on solid substrates. Four types of measurements
	covering the range from the macroscopic level to the molecular scale
	were made: ( 1) contact angle measurements of water droplets on these
	surfaces to obtain macroscopic scale data on the water-surface interaction,
	(2) atomic force microscopy measurements to provide micron to sub-micron
	level data on the surface topography, ( 3) transmission FTIR of the
	surfaces in the presence of increasing water vapor concentrations
	to probe the interaction with the surface at a molecular level, and
	( 4) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the elemental
	surface composition of the glass and quartz samples. Both borosilicate
	glass and the halocarbon wax coatings adsorbed significantly more
	water than the FEP Teflon film, which can be explained by a combination
	of the chemical nature of the surfaces and their physical topography.
	The C8 SAM, which is both hydrophobic and has a low surface roughness,
	takes up little water. The implications for the formation of thin

	a well-defined first hydration shell of NO3- is obtainable, but the

	and short to moderate ranged repulsion between iodide and CCl4. Hydrogen
	bond distance and angular distributions showed weaker water-water

	were faster at the interface, while for CCl4, its translational dynamics

	(SFG), has been used to investigate the interfacial water structure
	on a fused quartz surface modified by an octadecyltrichlorosilane
	(OTS) self-assembled monolayer in phosphate buffered solutions at
	various pHs. The experimental results demonstrate that the water
	molecules at the quartz/OTS surface flip while the water molecules
	at the OTS surface maintain their orientation when the solution pH
	is changed from neutral to acidic. The results show that most of

  abstract = {Statistical ensembles for simulating liquid interfaces at constant
	pressure and/or surface tension are examined, and equations of motion
	for molecular dynamics are obtained by various extensions of the
	Andersen extended system approach. Valid ensembles include: constant
	normal pressure and surface area; constant tangential pressure and
	length normal to the interface; constant volume and surface tension;
	and constant normal pressure and surface tension. Simulations at
	293 K and 1 atm normal pressure show consistent results with each
	other and with a simulation carried out at constant volume and energy.
	Calculated surface tensions for octane/water (61.5 dyn/cm), octane/vacuum
	(20.4 dyn/cm) and water/vacuum (70.2 dyn/cm) are in very good agreement
	with experiment (51.6, 21.7, and 72.8 dyn/cm, respectively). The
	practical consequences of simulating with two other approaches commonly
	used for isotropic systems are demonstrated on octane/water: applying
	equal normal and tangential pressures leads to an instability; and
	applying a constant isotropic pressure of 1 atm leads to a large
	positive normal pressure. Both results are expected for a system
	of nonzero surface tension. Mass density and water polarization profiles
	in the liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces are also compared.},
